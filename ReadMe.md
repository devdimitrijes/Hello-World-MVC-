# HelloWorldMvc 🌐

This is my first ASP.NET Core MVC project — a classic "Hello World" web application.

## 📚 Technologies Used:
- C# (ASP.NET Core MVC)
- Razor Views (.cshtml)
- HTML & CSS (basic layout and structure)

## 📝 Project Description:
The project is created as an introduction to ASP.NET Core MVC architecture. Through this project, I learned:
- How to create a Controller and a View.
- How routing works (e.g., /Hello/Index).
- The difference between `return View()` and `return Content()`.
- How to add a link from the Home page to navigate to other pages.

## 🔧 How to Run the Application:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devdimitrijes/HelloWorldMvc.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Run the application using IIS Express.

## 📂 Project Structure:
Controllers/
HelloController.cs
Views/
Hello/
Index.cshtml
Home/

wwwroot/
Program.cs


## 💡 What I Learned:
- Basics of ASP.NET Core MVC structure (Model-View-Controller pattern).
- Understanding how Controllers return Views.
- Integrating HTML with C# using Razor (.cshtml) files.
- Creating simple links between pages using Tag Helpers.

This project is a simple practice app, made for learning MVC fundamentals.
